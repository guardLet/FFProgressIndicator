     - Remark:
     1. Line view tag is added based on current index times **lineTagMultiplier** which has a default value of 100.

     - Parameters:
     - section: current section of the screen
     - subSection: current subsection of the section.
     
     - Notes:
     1. Progress view will animate the view from previous state to current state.
     2. Previous state is stored to avoid animation from the start
     3. Line View and Circle View are identified based on the tag they carry.
     4. Line Views have tags in multiplicative factor of lineTagMultiplier with current index.
     5. Circle Views have tags equal to current index.
     6. Circle fade animation is performed after circleFadeAnimationDuration is complete.

                 1. if the current section is same as the current index then we set the subsection to current subsection. i.e. this situation comes when the user has same previous and current section hence we set the current subsection to the setCompleted subsection.
